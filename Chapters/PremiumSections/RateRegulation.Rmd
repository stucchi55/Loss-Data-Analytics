<!-- ###  Rate Regulation {#S:RateRegulation} -->

The purposes of insurance regulation are to ensure the financial stability of insurers and to protect consumers. Insurers receive premiums in return for promises to pay in the event of a contingent (insured) event. Like other financial institutions such as banks, there is a strong public interest in promoting the continuing viability of an insurance company. Further, regulation is needed to protect consumers because:

a.	Insurance policies are complex legal documents that are often difficult to interpret and understand.
b.	Insurers write insurance policies and sell them to the public on a "take it or leave it" basis. Personal insurance is not a contract where each party has equal access to information (with their resources, insurers are thought to have greater access to information about risks they are insuring than consumers).

#### Market Conduct 

One aspects of regulation is known as *market conduct* regulation - systems of regulatory controls that have been established requiring insurers to demonstrate that they are providing fair and reliable services, including product regulation.

1. Product regulation serves to protect consumers by ensuring that insurance policy provisions are reasonable and fair, and do not contain major gaps in coverage that might be misunderstood by consumers and leave them unprotected.
2. The insurance product is the insurance contract (policy) and the coverage it provides. Insurance contracts are regulated for these reasons:
    a. Insurance policies are complex legal documents that are often difficult to interpret and understand.
    b. Insurers write insurance policies and sell them to the public on a "take it or leave it" basis.

Market conduct includes rules for intermediaries such as agents (who sell insurance to individuals) and brokers (who sell insurance to businesses). Market conduct also includes competition policy regulation, designed to ensure an efficient and competitive marketplace that offers low prices to consumers. 


#### Rate Regulation 

The focus of the premium chapter is rate (and policy form) regulation. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that insurers not take unfair advantage of consumers. Rate and policy form regulation are common worldwide.

The amount of regulatory scrutiny varies by insurance product. Rate regulation is uncommon in life insurance. Further, in non-life insurance, most commercial lines and reinsurance are free from regulation. Rate regulation is most common in automobile insurance, health insurance, workers compensation, medical malpractice, and homeowners insurance. These are markets in which insurance is mandatory or in which universal coverage is thought to be socially desirable.

There are three principles that guide rate regulation: 

* rates be adequate (to maintain insurance company solvency), 
* but not excessive (not so high as to lead to exorbitant profits), 
* nor unfairly discriminatory (price differences must reflect expected claim and expense differences). 

Recently, in auto and home insurance, the twin issues of availability and affordability, which are not explicitly included in the guiding principles, have been assuming greater importance in regulatory decisions.


#### Types of Rate Regulation 

There are several methods, that vary by the level of scrutiny, by which regulators may restrict the rates that insurers offer.

The most restrictive is a *government prescribed* regulatory system, where the government regulator determines and promulgates the rates, classifications, forms, and so forth, to which all insurers must adhere. Also restrictive are *prior approval* systems. Here, the insurer must file rates, rules, and so forth, with government regulators. Depending on the statute, the filing becomes effective when a specified waiting period elapses (if the government regulator does not take specific action on the filing, it is deemed approved automatically) or when the government regulator formally approves the filing.

The least restrictive would be a *no file* or *record maintenance* system where the insurer need not file rates, rules, and so forth, with the government regulator. The regulator may periodically examine the insurer to ensure compliance with the law. Another relatively flexible system is the *file only* system, also known as *competitive* rating, where the insurer simply keeps files to ensure compliance with the law.

In between these two extremes are the (1) file and use, (2) use and file, (3) modified prior approval, and (4) flex rating systems.

1. File and Use: The insurer must file rates, rules, and so forth, with the government regulator. The filing becomes effective immediately or on a future date specified by the filer.
2. Use and File: The filing becomes effective when used. The insurer must file rates, rules, and so forth, with the government regulator within a specified time period after first use.
3. Modified Prior Approval: This is a hybrid of "prior approval" and "file and use" laws. If the rate revision is based solely on a change in loss experience then "file and use" may apply. However, if the rate revision is based on a change in expense relationships or rate classifications, then "prior approval" may apply. 
4. Flex (or Band) Rating: The insurer may increase or decrease a rate within a "flex band," or range, without approval of the government regulator. Generally, either "file and use" or "use and file" provisions apply.


#### Rates are Not Unfairly Discriminatory 

Government regulation of prices takes on two forms:

1.	The size of premium rates
2.	Restrict the type of information that can be used in risk classification.

Examples of (potentially) prohibited rating factors

- Ethnicity/Race
- Political affiliation
- Religion
- Hobbies and other interests unrelated to risk of loss
- Economic status

Should we collect these variables?

- Sometimes no. Just the act of collecting them means that we may become biased in subtle ways, a type of moral hazard.
- Sometimes yes. Either the status is uncertain or we may wish to understand their effects and prove that we are not being biased.
