<!-- ## Introduction to Ratemaking-->

This chapter explains how you can think about determining the appropriate price for an insurance product. As described in Section \@ref(S:PredModApps), one of the core actuarial functions is `r Gloss('ratemaking')`, where the  analyst seeks to determine the right price for a risk.

As this is a core function, let us first take a step back to define terms. A `r Gloss('price')` is a quantity, usually of money, that is exchanged for a good or service. In insurance, we typically use the word `r Gloss('premium')` for the amount of money charged for insurance protection against contingent events. The amount of protection varies by risk being insured. For example, in homeowners insurance the amount of insurance protection depends on the value of the house. In life insurance, the amount of protection depends on a policyholder's financial status (e.g. income and wealth) as well as a perceived need for financial security. So, it is common to express insurance prices as a unit of the protection being purchased, for example, an amount per thousands (e.g., of dollars or Euros) for coverage of a home or benefit in the event of death. Because they are expressed in standardized units, these prices/premiums are known as `r Gloss('rates')`.

To determine premiums, it is common in economics to consider the supply and demand of a product. The demand is sensitive to price as well as the existence of competiting firms and substitute products. The supply is a function of the resources required for production. For the individual firm, the price is set to meet some objective such as profit maximization which is met by choosing the output level that balances costs and revenues at the margins.

However, a peculiarity of insurance is that the costs of insurance protection are not known at the sale of the contract. If the `r Gloss('insured contingent event')`, such as the loss of a house or life, does not occur, then the contract costs are only administrative (to set up the contract) and are relatively minor. If the insured event occurs, then the cost includes not only administrative costs but also payment of the amount insured and expenses to settle claims. So, the cost is random; when the contract is written, by design neither the insurer nor the insured knows the contract costs. Moreover, costs may not be revealed for months or years. For example, a typical time to settlement in medical malpractice is five years.

Because costs are unknown at the time of sale, insurance pricing differs from common economic approaches.
This chapter squarely addresses the uncertain nature of costs by introducing traditional actuarial approaches that determine prices as a function of insurance costs. As we will see, this pricing approach is sufficient for some insurance markets such as personal automobile or homeowners where the insurer has a portfolio of many independent risks. However, there are other insurance markets where actuarial prices only provide an input to general market prices. To reinforce this distinction, actuarial cost-based premiums are sometimes known as `r Gloss('technical prices')`. From the perspective of economists, corporate decisions such as pricing are to be evaluated with reference to their impact on the firm's market value. This objective is more comprehensive than the static notion of profit maximization. That is, you can think of the value of the firm represents the capitalized value of all future expected profits. Decisions impacting this value in turn affect all groups having claims on the firm, including stockholders, bondholders, policyowners (in the case of mutual companies), and so forth.

<!-- Given that costs are not incurred or even known at the time of sale, this chapter focuses on the costs of supplying insurance, following the actuarial literature. This is not a complete picture of everything needed to price insurance.  -->

For cost-based prices, it is helpful to think of a premium as revenue source that provides for claim payments, contract expenses, and an operating margin. We formalize this in an accounting equation

\begin{equation}
\small{
\text{Premium = Loss + Expense + UW Profit} .
}
(\#eq:AccountingEquation)
\end{equation}

Expenses can be split into those that vary by premium (such as sales commissions) and those that do not (such as building costs and employee salaries). The term `UW Profit` is a residual that stands for `r Gloss('underwriting profit')`. It may also include include a cost of capital (for example, an annual dividend to company investors). Because fixed expenses and costs of capital are difficult to interpret for individual contracts, we think of the equation \@ref(eq:AccountingEquation) relationship as holding over the sum of many contracts (a portfolio) and work with it in *aggregate*. Then, in Section \@ref(S:AggRateMaking) we use this approach to help us think about setting premiums, for example by setting profit objectives. Specifically, Sections \@ref(S:PurePremium)  and \@ref(S:LossRatio) introduce two prevailing methods used in practice for determining premiums, the `r Gloss('pure premium')` and the `r Gloss('loss ratio')` methods.

The `Loss` in equation \@ref(eq:AccountingEquation) is random and so, as a baseline, we use the *expected costs* to determine rates. There are several ways to motivate this perspective that we expand upon in Section \@ref(S:PricingPrinciples). For now, we will suppose that the insurer enters into many contracts with risks that are similar except, by pure chance, in some cases the insured event occurs and in others it does not. The insurer is obligated to pay the total amount of claims payments for all contracts. If risks are similar, then all policyholders should be responsible for the same amount which is the average claim payment. So, from this perspective, it makes sense to look at the average claim payment over many insureds. From probability theory, specifically the law of large numbers, we know that the average of `r Gloss('iid')` risks is close to the expected amount, so we use the expectation as a baseline pricing principle.

Nonetheless, by using expected losses, we essentially assume that the uncertainty is non-existent. If the insurers sells enough independent policies, this may be a reasonable approximation. However, there will be other cases, such as a single contract issued to a large corporation to insure all of its buildings against fire damage, where the use of only an expectation for pricing is not sufficient. So, Section \@ref(S:PricingPrinciples) also summarizes alternative premium principles that incorporate uncertainty into our pricing. Note that an emphasis of this text is estimation of the entire distribution of losses so the analyst is not restricted to working only with expectations.

The aggregate methods derived from equation \@ref(eq:AccountingEquation) focus on collections of `r Gloss('homogeneous risks')` that are similar except for the occurrence of random losses. In statistical language that we have introduced, this is a discussion about risks that have identical distributions. Naturally, when examining risks that insurers work with, there are many variations in the risks being insured including the features of the contracts and the people being insured.  Section \@ref(S:HeterogeneousRisks) extends pricing considerations to `r Gloss('heterogeneous')` collections of risks.

Section \@ref(S:TrendDevelopment) introduces ideas of development and trending. When developing rates, we want to use the most recent loss experience because the goal is to develop rates that are forward looking. However, at contract initiation, recent loss experience is often not known; it may be several years until it is fully realized. So, this section introduces concepts needed for incorporating recent loss experience into our premium development. Development and trending of experience is related to but also differs from the idea of `r Gloss('experience rating')` that suggests that experience reveals hidden information about the insured and so should be incorporated in our forward thinking viewpoint. Chapter \@ref(C:Credibility) discusses this idea in more detail.

The final section of this chapter introduces methods for selecting a premium. This is done by comparing a premium rating method to losses from a held-out portfolio and selecting the method that produces the best match with the held-out data. For a typical insurance portfolio, most policies produce zero losses, that is, do not have a claim. Because the distribution of held-out losses is a combination of (a large number of) zeros and continuous amounts, special techniques are useful. Section \@ref(S:GiniStatistic) introduces concepts of *concentration curves* and corresponding *Gini statistics* to help in this selection.

The chapter also includes a technical supplement on government regulation of `r Gloss('insurance rates')` to keep our work grounded in applications.
