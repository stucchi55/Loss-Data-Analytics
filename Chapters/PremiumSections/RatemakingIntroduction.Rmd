<!-- ## Introduction to Ratemaking-->

This chapter explains how you can think about determining the appropriate price for an insurance product. As described in Section \@ref(S:PredModApps), one of the core actuarial functions is ratemaking, where the  analyst seeks to determine the right price for the right risk.

As this is a core function, let us first take a step back to define terms. A `r Gloss('price')` is a quantity, usually of money, that is exchanged for a good or service. In insurance, we typically use the word `r Gloss('premium')` for the amount of money charged for insurance protection against contingent events. The amount of protection varies by risk being insured. For example, in homeowners insurance the amount of insurance protection depends on the value of the house. In life insurance, the amount of protection depends on a policyholder's financial status (e.g. income and wealth) as well as a perceived need for financial security. So, it is common to express insurance prices as a unit of the protection being purchased, for example, an amount per thousands (e.g., of dollars or Euros) for coverage of a home or benefit in the event of death. Because they are expressed in standardized units, these prices/premiums are known as `r Gloss('rates')`.

To determine premiums, it is common in economics to use as a benchmark a perfectly competitive market where the marginal price equals the marginal cost of producing a good or service, resulting in zero (marginal) profits. However, a peculiarity of insurance is that the costs of insurance protection are not known when the contract is entered. If the insured contingent event, such as the loss of a house or life, does not occur, then the contract costs are only administrative and are relatively minor. If the insured event occurs, then the cost includes not only administrative costs to set up the contract but also payment of the amount insured and expenses to settle claims. So, when the contract is written, by design neither the insurer nor the insured knows the costs associated with each contract.

As a baseline, we use the *expected costs* to determine rates. There are several ways to motivate this perspective and we expand upon this point in Section \@ref(S:PricingPrinciples). For now, we will suppose that the insurer enters into many contracts with risks that are similar except, by pure chance, in some cases the insured event occurs and in others it does not. The insurer is obligated to pay the total amount of claims payments for all contracts. If risks are similar, then all policyholders should be responsible for the same amount which is the average claim payment. So, from this perspective, it makes sense to look at the average claim payment over many insureds. From probability theory, specifically the law of large numbers, we know that the average of `r Gloss('iid')` risks is close to the expected amount, so we use the expectation as a baseline pricing principle.

To take a step closer to methods used in practice, we next make the contract expenses a bit more explicit. Consider an accounting equation 

\begin{equation}
\small{
\text{Premium = Loss + Fixed + Variable + UW Profit} .
}
(\#eq:AccountingEquation)
\end{equation}

Expenses are split between those that vary by premium (`Variable`, such as commissions) and those that do not (`Fixed`). Here, `UW Profit` is for underwriting profit. Equation \@ref(eq:AccountingEquation) summarizes a basic accounting relationship among premiums, losses, expenses, and profits. We will think of this relationship as holding over the sum of many contracts and work with it in *aggregate*. Then, in Section \@ref(S:AggRateMaking) we use this approach to help us think about setting premiums, for example by setting profit objectives. Specifically, Sections \@ref(S:PurePremium)  and \@ref(S:LossRatio) introduce two prevailing methods used in practice for determining premiums, the `r Gloss('pure premium')` and the `r Gloss('loss ratio')` methods.

Section \@ref(S:PricingPrinciples) will describe why the expectation is a useful baseline premium principle. Although a useful baseline, expectations do not account for all aspects of a contract; for example, expectations do not account for the uncertainty of an insurance contract. To illustrate, using only expectations a deterministic value of 0.5 is treated in the same way as a 50% loss of 1 (with 50% chance of 0 corresponding to no loss). There are important insurance situations where we wish to incorporate uncertainty into our pricing and so Section \@ref(S:PricingPrinciples) also summarizes alternative premium principles that do so. Note that an emphasis of this text is estimation of the entire distribution of losses so the analyst is not restricted to working only with expectations. 

The aggregate methods derived from the accounting equation \@ref(eq:AccountingEquation) focus on collections of `r Gloss('homogeneous risks')` that are similar except for the occurrence of random losses. In statistical language that we have introduced, this is a discussion about risks that have identical distributions. When adding the assumption of independence, we summarize this by saying that the risks are *iid*. Naturally, when examining risks that insurers work with, there are many variations in the risks being insured including the features of the contracts and the people being insured.  Section \@ref(S:HeterogeneousRisks) extends pricing considerations to `r Gloss('heterogeneous')` collections of risks.

Section \@ref(S:TrendDevelopment) introduces ideas of development and trending. The goal is to develop rates that are forward looking. At contract initiation the rates are known but the losses that are being insured against have not yet occurred. Just because an insurer has a bad year, this should not be reflected in rates. (However, the idea of `r Gloss('experience rating')` suggests that experience reveals hidden information about the insured and so should be incorporated in our forward thinking viewpoint. Chapter \@ref(C:Credibility) discusses this idea in more detail.).
