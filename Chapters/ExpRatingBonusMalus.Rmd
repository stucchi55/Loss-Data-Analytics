## Introduction {#S:ERBM:Intro}

`r Gloss('Bonus-malus system')`, which is used interchangeably as "no-fault
discount", "merit rating", "experience rating" or "no-claim discount" in
different countries, is based on penalizing insureds who are responsible
for one or more claims by a premium surcharge, and awarding insureds
with a premium discount if they do not have any claims. Insurers use
bonus-malus systems for two main purposes; to encourage drivers to drive
more carefully in a year without any claims, and to ensure insureds to
pay premiums proportional to their risks based on their claims
experience.

`r Gloss("No Claim Discount (NCD) system")` is an experience rating system commonly
used in motor insurance. It represents an attempt to categorize insureds
into homogeneous groups who pay premiums based on their claims
experience. Depending on the rules in the scheme, new policyholders may
be required to pay full premium initially, and obtain discounts in the
future years as a results of claim-free years. An NCD system rewards
policyholders for not making any claims during a year, or in other
words, it grants a bonus to a careful driver. This bonus principle may
affect policy holders' decisions whether to claim or not to claim,
especially when involving accidents with slight damages, which is known
as '`r Gloss('hunger for bonus')`' phenomenon. The option of 'hunger for bonus' under
an NCD system may reduce insurers' claim costs, and may be able to
offset the expected decrease in premium income.

## NCD System in Several Countries {#S:ERBM:NCD}

### NCD System in Malaysia

Before the liberalization of Motor Tariff on 1st July 2017, the rating
of motor insurance in Malaysia was governed by Motor Tariff. Under the
tariff, the rate charged should not be lower than the rates specified
under the classes of risks, to ensure that the price competition among
insurers will not go below the country's economic level. The basic
rating factors considered were scope of insurance, cubic capacity of
vehicle and estimated value of vehicle (or sum insured, whichever is
lower). Under the Motor Tariff, the final premium to be paid is adjusted
by the policyholder's claim experience, or equivalently, his NCD
entitlement.

Effective on 1st July 2017, the premium rates for motor insurance are
liberalized, or de-tariffed. The pricing of premium is now determined by
individual insurers and `r Gloss('takaful')` operators, and the consumers are able to
enjoy a wider choice of motor insurance products at competitive prices.
Since tariff liberalization encourages innovation and competition among
insurers and takaful operators, the premiums are based on broader risk
factors other than the two rating factors specified in the Motor Tariff,
i.e. sum insured and cubic capacity of vehicle. Other rating factors may
be defined in the risk profile of an insured, such as age of vehicle,
age of driver, safety and security features of vehicle, geographical
location of vehicle and traffic offences of driver. As different
insurers and takaful operators have different ways of defining the risk
profile of an insured, the price of a policy may differ from one insurer
to another. However, the NCD structure from the Motor Tariff remains
'unchanged' and continue to exist, and is 'transferable' from one
insurer, or from one takaful operator, to another.

The discounts in the Malaysian NCD system are divided into six classes,
starting from the initial class of 0% discount, followed by classes of
25%, 30%, 38.3%, 45% and 55% discounts. Table 1 provides the classes of
NCD system in Malaysia. A claim-free year indicates that a policyholder
is entitled to move one-step forward to the next discount class, such as
from a 0% discount to a 25% discount in the renewal year. If a
policyholder is already at the highest class, which is at a 55%
discount, a claim-free year indicates that the policyholder remains in
the same class. On the other hand, if one or more claims are made within
the year, the NCD will be forfeited and the policyholder has to start at
0% discount in the renewal year. In other words, the policyholder has to
pay a full premium for the next year's renewal premium, regardless of
his current class of NCD.

For an illustration purpose, Figure \@ref(fig:TransitionMsia) shows the transition diagram for
the NCD classes under the Malaysian Motor Tariff. The transition starts
at class 0, and increase one by one if an insured has a no-claim year.
If an insured has one or more claims within the year, the current class
automatically returns to class 0.

### NCD System in Other Countries

The NCD system in Brazil are subdivided into seven classes, with the
following premium levels (Lemaire 1998): 100, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70, and
65. These premium levels are also equivalent to the following discount
classes: 0%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% and 45%. New policyholders have to
start at 0% discount, or at level 100, and a claim-free year indicates
that a policyholder can move forward at a one-class discount. If one or
more claims incurred within the year, the policyholder has to move
backward, also at a one-class discount. Table 2 and Figure \@ref(fig:TransitionBrazil)
respectively show the classes and the transition diagram for the NCD
system in Brazil.

\[

knitr::include_graphics("Figures/FigureTransitionBrazil.png")
```

The NCD system in Switzerland, which is implemented in 1990, are
subdivided into twenty-two classes, with the following premium levels:
270, 250, 230, 215, 200, 185, 170, 155, 140, 130, 120, 110, 100, 90, 80,
75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50 and 45 (Lemaire and Zi 1994). These levels are
also equivalent to the following loadings: 170%, 150%, 130%, 115%, 100%,
85%, 70%, 55%, 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10%, and the following discounts: 0%,
10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50% and 55%. New policyholders have
to start at 170% loading, or at 270 premium level, and a claim-free year
indicates that a policyholder can move one-class forward. If one or more
claims incurred within the year, the policyholder has to move
four-classes backwards. Table 3 and Figure \@ref(fig:TransitionSwitz) respectively show the
classes and the transition diagram for the NCD system in Switzerland.

## BMS and Markov Chain Model {#S:ERBM:BMS}

A BMS, or an NCD system, can be represented by a discrete time parameter
`r Gloss('Markov chain')`. Under this model, the state space consists of classes of
bonus-malus, and the state (or class) is assumed to shift randomly from
year to year. Therefore, it is important to know a brief description on
two elements; a stochastic process that has a Markov property, and a
discrete time Markov chain.

**Definition:** A ***stochastic process*** has a Markov property if the
[probability
distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability_distribution)
of future states, conditional on both past and present states, depends
only upon the present state and not on the sequence of events that
preceded it.

**Definition:** A ***discrete time Markov chain*** is a stochastic
process that can be parameterized by empirically estimating the
transition probabilities between discrete states.

### Transition Probability

The randomness of the transition of the NCD classes is governed by the
transition probability in a given year. The definition of a transition
probability is provided here to understand the use of the probability
for representing the transition of the NCD classes.

**Definition:** The ***transition probability*** from state $i$
(at time $n$) to state $j$ (at time $n + 1$) is
called a one-step transition probability, and is denoted by
$p_{ij} = Pr (X_{n + 1} = j|X_n = i)$, $i = 1,2,...,k$, $j = 1,2,...,k$.

The transition probabilities can be represented by a $k \times k$ matrix. Assuming a homogeneous Markov process, a *k*-state Markov
chain can be represented by a ***matrix of transition probabilities***
${\bf P}$:

\[
{\bf P} = 
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
p_{11} & p_{12} & \ldots & & & p_{1k} \\
p_{21} & p_{22} & \ldots & & & p_{2k} \\ 
\vdots & \ddots & & & & \vdots \\
 & & & & & \\
 & & & & & \\
p_{k1} & p_{k2} & \cdots & & & p_{kk}   
\end{array} } \right].
\]

Each row of the `r Gloss('transition matrix')` represents the transition of flowing
out of state, whereas each column represents the transition of flowing
into the state. The cumulative transitions of flowing out of state must
equal 1, or each row of the matrix must sum to 1, i.e.
$\sum\limits_j p_{ij} = 1$. All probabilities must also
be non-negative (since they are probabilities), i.e. $p_{ij} \ge 0$.

Consider the Malaysian NCD system. Under this system, let the random
variable $X_t$ denotes the class of NCD at time $t$
and takes the values in a state space $\bf{S}$, where
${\bf S} = \{0,1,...,5\}$. Therefore, the probability of
a no-claim year is equal to the probability of transition from state
$i$ to state $j$, which is $p_{ij}$, $i = 0,1,2,...,5$, $j = 0,1,2,...,5$. If an insured has one or
more claims within the year, the probability of transitioning back to
state 0 is represented by $p_{i0}$, which is also equivalent
to $1 - {p_{ij}}.$ Therefore, there are only two transition
probabilities in each row; the probability of advancing to the next
state, $p_{ij},$ and the probability of returning back to
state zero, $p_{i0} = 1 - p_{ij}$.

In terms of transition probabilities, the Malaysian NCD system can be
represented by the following $(6 \times 6)$ transition matrix:

\[
{\bf P} = 
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
p_{00}&p_{01}&0&0&0&0\\
p_{10}&0&p_{12}&0&0&0\\
p_{20}&0&0&p_{23}&0&0\\
p_{30}&0&0&0&p_{34}&0\\
p_{40}&0&0&0&0&p_{45}\\
p_{50}&0&0&0&0&p_{55}
\end{array} }\right] = 
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c}
{1 - p_{01}}&p_{01}&0&0&0&0\\
{1 - p_{12}}&0&p_{12}&0&0&0\\
{1 - p_{23}}&0&0&p_{23}&0&0\\
{1 - p_{34}}&0&0&0&p_{34}&0\\
{1 - p_{45}}&0&0&0&0&p_{45}\\
{1 - p_{55}}&0&0&0&0&p_{55}
\end{array} }\right]
\]

***Example 1***

*Provide the transition matrix for the NCD system in Brazil.*

***Solution***

*Based on the NCD classes and the transition diagram shown respectively
in Table 2 and Figure \@ref(fig:TransitionBrazil), the probability of a no-claim year is equal to
the probability of moving one-class forward, whereas the probability of
having one or more claims within the year is equal to the probability of
moving one-class backward. Therefore, each row can contain two or more
transition probabilities; one probability for advancing to the next
state, and one or more probabilities for moving one-class backwards. The
transition matrix is:*

\[
{\bf P} = 
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{1 - p_{01}}&p_{01}&0&0&0&0&0\\
{1 - p_{12}}&0&p_{12}&0&0&0&0\\
{1 - \sum\limits_j p_{2j}}&p_{21}&0&p_{23}&0&0&0\\
{1 - \sum\limits_j p_{3j}}&p_{31}&p_{32}&0&p_{34}&0&0\\\
{1 - \sum\limits_j p_{4j}}&p_{41}&p_{42}&p_{43}&0&p_{45}&0\\
{1 - \sum\limits_j p_{5j}}&p_{51}&p_{52}&p_{53}&p_{54}&0&p_{56}\\
{1 - \sum\limits_j p_{6j}}&p_{61}&p_{62}&p_{63}&p_{64}&p_{65}&p_{66}
\end{array} } \right]
\]

***Example 2***

*Provide the transition matrix for the NCD system in Switzerland.*

***Solution***

*From Table 3 and Figure* \@ref(fig:TransitionSwitz)*, the probability of a no-claim year is equal to the probability of moving one-class forward, whereas the probability of having one or more claims within the year is equal to the probability of moving four-classes backward. The transition matrix is:*

$$
\begin{matrix}
\left|
{\begin{array}{*{12}{c}}
1 - {p_{01}} & p_{01} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots\\

\end{matrix}
$$

## BMS and Stationary Distribution {#S:ERBM:StatDist}

### Stationary Distribution

It is important to note that the transition matrix represents the
transition probabilities of the NCD classes in one year. If we are
interested in the distribution of the transition in the long run (which
may take several years), the stationary probability can be used.

Several definitions and properties are provided here to understand the
use of a Markov chain model for representing the stationary distribution of the NCD transitions. However, students are encouraged to refer to
textbooks on Markov Chain and stochastic processes available in the
literature for a more comprehensive knowledge on the related subjects.

**Definition:** A Markov chain is said to be ***irreducible*** if it is
possible to move to any state from any other state.

**Definition:** A state $i$ has **period** $k$ if
any return to state $i$ must occur in multiples of
$k$ time steps. If $k = 1$, then the state is said to
be ***aperiodic***.

**Definition:** A state $i$ is said to be **transient** if,
given that we start in state $i$, there is a non-zero
probability that we will never return to $i$.
State $i$ is recurrent (or persistent) if it is not
transient. A state $i$ is ***positive recurrent*** if the
**mean recurrent time** (or expected return time) is ***finite***.

**Definition:** A state $i$ is said to
be *[**ergodic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory)* if it
is aperiodic and positive recurrent. In other words, a state $i$
is ergodic if it is recurrent, has a period of one (aperiodic), and has
finite mean recurrence time. If all states in an irreducible Markov
chain are ergodic, then the chain is said to be ergodic.

**Definition:** Let $p_{ij}^{(n)} = \Pr ({X_n} = j\|{X_0} = i)$ be the probability of transition from state $i$ to
state $j$ in $n$ time steps. The *n*-step transition
probabilities for a ***stationary Markov chain*** satisfy
the *[**Chapman--Kolmogorov equation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman%E2%80%93Kolmogorov_equation):*

\[p_{ij}^{(n)} = \sum\limits_r {p_{ir}^{(k)}p_{rj}^{(n - k)}}\]

for any $k$, where $0 < k < n$.

**Definition:** If a Markov chain is
*[stationary](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time-homogeneous_Markov_chain&action=edit&redlink=1)*, then the vector ${\bf{\pi }}$ is called a `r Gloss('stationary distribution')` 
(or *[invariant measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_measure)*)
if it satisfies:

\[0 \le {\pi _j} \le 1\]

\[\sum\limits_j {{\pi _j}} = 1,\]

\[{\pi_j} = \sum\limits_i {\pi_i}p_{ij}\].

In terms of vectors and matrices, a stationary
distribution ${\bf{\pi }}$ is a row vector, whose entries
are non-negative and sum to one, that is unchanged by the operation:

${\bf{\pi P}} = {\bf{\pi }}$.

If a Markov chain is stationary, then the transition
matrix ${\bf{P}}$ is the same after each step, so that
the $k$-step transition probability can be computed as the $k$-th power
of the transition matrix, ${{\bf{P}}^k}.$

From the definitions and properties above, a BMS forms a regular Markov
chain if all of its states (NCD classes) are `r Gloss('ergodic')`, and the
chain is not cyclic (or `r Gloss('irreversible')`). The row vector,
${\bf{\pi }}$, which is also the ***left*** `r Gloss('eigenvector')` of
the transition matrix, is a ***stationary distribution*** defined by
$0 \le {\pi _j} \le 1$ and $\sum\limits_j {{\pi_j}} = 1$.

***Example 3***

*Find the stationary distribution for the NCD system in Malaysia assuming that the probability of a no-claim year for all NCD classes are ${p_0}$.*

***Solution***

*The transition matrix can be re-written as:*



*The stationary distribution can be calculated using* ${\pi _j} = \sum\limits_i {\pi _i}p_{ij}$*. The solutions are:*

\[
\begin{array}{l}
{\pi _0} = \sum\limits_i {\pi_i}p_{i0} = (1 - {p_0})\sum\limits_i {{\pi _i}} = 1 - {p_0}\\\\
{\pi _1} = \sum\limits_i {\pi _i}p_{i1} = {\pi_0}{p_{01}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}\\\\
{\pi _2} = \sum\limits_i {\pi _i}p_{i2} = {\pi _1}{p_{12}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^2\\\\
{\pi _3} = \sum\limits_i {\pi _i}p_{i3} = {\pi _2}{p_{23}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^3\\\\
{\pi _4} = \sum\limits_i {\pi _i}p_{i4} = {\pi _3}{p_{34}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^4\\\\
{\pi _5} = \sum\limits_i {\pi _i}p_{i5} = {\pi _4}{p_{45}} + {\pi _5}{p_{55}} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^5 + {\pi _5}{p_0}\\\\
\therefore {\pi _5} = \frac{(1 - {p_0}){p_0}^5}{{(1 - {p_0})}} = {p_0}^5
\end{array}
\]

The stationary distribution (or steady state condition) shown in Example
3 represents the asymptotic distribution of the NCD system, or the
distribution in the long run. As an example, assuming that the
probability of a no-claim year is $p_0 = 0.90,$ the
***stationary probabilities*** are:

\[
\begin{array}{l}
{\pi _0} = 1 - {p_0} = 0.1000\\\\
{\pi _1} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0} = 0.0900\\\\
{\pi _2} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^2 = 0.0810\\\\
{\pi _3} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^3 = 0.0729\\\\
{\pi _4} = (1 - {p_0}){p_0}^4 = 0.0656\\\\
{\pi _5} = {p_0}^5 = 0.5905
\end{array}
\]

In other words, ${\pi_0} = 0.10$ indicates that 10% of
insureds will eventually belong to class 0 (or zero claim-free years),
${\pi _1} = 0.09$ indicates that 9% of insureds will
eventually belong to class 1 (or one claim-free year), and so forth,
until ${\pi _5} = 0.59$, which indicates that 59% of
insureds will eventually belong to class 5 (or five successive
claim-free years).

### R Program for Stationary Distribution

We can use the left eigenvector of a transition matrix to calculate the
stationary distribution. The following R program can be used to
calculate the left eigenvector:

```{r, echo=SHOW_PDF}
#create transition matrix
entries=c(0.1,0.9,0,0,0,0,
+ 0.1,0,0.9,0,0,0,
+ 0.1,0,0,0.9,0,0,
+ 0.1,0,0,0,0.9,0,
+ 0.1,0,0,0,0,0.9,
+ 0.1,0,0,0,0,0.9)
TP=matrix(entries,nrow=6,byrow=TRUE)
TP

#calculate left eigenvector
#hint -- left eigenvector is the same as right eigenvector of transpose of transition matrix
eigen(t(TP))

#divide entry of first column by sum of elements, so that entries sum to 1
#provide answers in 4 decimal places
round(eigen(t(TP))$vectors[,1]/sum(eigen(t(TP))$vectors[,1]),4)
```

***Example 4***

*Find the stationary distribution for the NCD system in Brazil assuming that the number of successive years of claims is Poisson distributed with parameter* $\lambda = 0.10$.

***Solution***

*Under the Poisson distribution, the probability of* $k$
*successive years of claims is* $p_k = \frac{e^{ - 0.1}{(0.1)}^k}{{k!}},{\rm{ }}k = 0,1,2,.....$

*The transition matrix is:*

\[
{\small {\bf{P}} = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{1 - {p_0}}&{{p_0}}&0&0&0&0&0\\\\
{1 - {p_0}}&0&{{p_0}}&0&0&0&0\\\\

\end{array}}\right]}
\]

*Using R program, the stationary probabilities are:*

\[
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{{\pi _0}}\\\\
{{\pi_1}}\\\\

*The probabilities indicate that 89% of insureds will eventually belong
to class 6 (six successive claim-free years), 9% of insureds will
eventually belong to class 5 (five successive claim-free years), and
1.5% of insureds will eventually belong to class 4 (four successive
claim-free years). Other classes, after combined, have less than 1% of
insureds.*

***Example 5***

*Using the results from Example 4, find the final premium under the
steady state condition assuming that the premium prior to implementing
the NCD is* $m.$

***Solution***

*Using the stationary probabilities from Example 4, the stationary final
premium is:*

$$
\begin{array}{l} = 
\sum\limits_j \text{(premium)} \times 
\text{(proportion in class } j \text{ in the long run)} \times \text{(1 - NCD in class } j)\\\\ 
= m[{\pi _0}(1) + {\pi _1}(1 - 0.9) + {\pi _2}(1 - 0.15) + \ldots + {\pi _6}(1 - 0.35)]\\\\ 
= m[0 + 0 + (0.0003)(0.85) + \ldots + (0.8894)(0.65)]\\\\
= 0.6565m
\end{array}
$$

*The results indicate that the final premium reduce from m to 0.6565m in
the long run (under steady state condition or stationary condition) if
the NCD is considered.*

### Premium Evolution

Sometimes we are interested to observe the evolution of the mean premium
after $n$ years (or $n$ steps). Under the NCD system,
the `r Gloss("n-step transition probability")`, $p_{ij}^{(n)}$, can be
used to observe the evolution of the mean premium. A definition on
*n*-step transition probabaility $p_{ij}^{(n)}$ is provided
here to understand the use of the probability for observing the
evolution of the mean premium.

**Definition:** Let $p_{ij} = \Pr ({X_{n + 1}} = j|{X_n} = i)$ be a ***one-step transition probability*** from state
$i$ to state $j$, and $p_{ij}^{(n)} = \Pr
({X_n} = j|{X_0} = i)$, $n = 1,2,...$, be an n-step transition probability from state $i$ to state
$j$. The probability $p_{ij}^{(n)}$ can be obtained
using the $n$th power of transition matrix
${\bf{P}}$, which is ${\bf{P}^n}.$

***Example 6***

*Observe the premiums in 20 years under the NCD system in Malaysia, assuming that the probability of claims is Poisson distributed with parameter* $\lambda = 0.10$ *and the premium prior to implementing the NCD is* $m = 100$*.*

***Solution***

*Under the Malaysian NCD, we use the Poisson probability,* $p_k = \frac{e^{ - 0.1}{(0.1)}^k}{k!}$*, only for* $k = 0,1.$ *Therefore, the transition matrix in the first year is:*

\[
{\bf{P}^{(1)}} = 
\left[{\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{0.0952}&{0.9048}&0&0&0&0\\\\
{0.0952}&0&{0.9048}&0&0&0\\\\
{0.0952}&0&0&{0.9048}&0&0\\\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&{0.9048}&0\\\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&0&{0.9048}\\\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&0&{0.9048}
\end{array}} \right]
\]

*The premium in the first year, after implementing the NCD, is:*

$$
\begin{aligned} 
&= \sum\limits_j \text{(premium)} \times 
\text{(average proportion in class } j) \times \text{(1 - NCD in class }j) \\
&= m\left[ \frac{\sum\limits_i {p_{i0}}}{6}{(1)} +
\frac{\sum\limits_i {p_{i1}}}{6}{(1 - 0.25)} + \ldots +
\frac{\sum\limits_i {p_{i5}}}{6}{(1 - 0.55)} \right]\\
&=
100[0.0952(1) + 0.1508(0.75) + \cdots + 0.3016(0.45)]\\
&= 62.55.
\end{aligned}
$$

*Using similar steps, the premium in the* $n$*-th year for*
$n = 1,2,...,20$ *can be observed. From R program, the premiums in 20 years are:*

*62.55, 59.87, 58.06, 57.06, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58,*

*56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58, 56.58.*

### R Program for Premium Evolution

year and the premiums in 20 years under the NCD system in Malaysia (to

***Solution***

*The transition matrix for the NCD system in Brazil is:*

\[

\end{array}} \right]
\]

*Using R program the premiums in 20 years are:*

*76.69, 73.76, 71.31, 69.38, 67.92, 66.93, 66.40, 66.05, 65.88, 65.78,*

The results in Examples 6-7 allow us to observe the evolution of premium
for the NCD systems in Malaysia and Brazil assuming that the number of
successive years of claims is Poisson distributed with parameter
$\lambda = 0.10$, and the premium prior to implementing the
NCD is $m = 100$. The evolutions of premiums for both countries
are provided in Table 4, and are shown graphically in Figure \@ref(fig:PremEvolution).

### Convergence Rate

Sometimes we are interested to know the variation between the
probability in the *n*-th year, $p_{ij}^{(n)}$, and the
stationary probability, $\pi _j$. The variation between the
probabilities can be measured using:

\[\left| {average(p_{ij}^{(n)}) - {\pi _j}} \right|\].

Therefore, the total variation can be measured by the sum of variation
in all classes:

\[\sum\limits_j {\left| {average(p_{ij}^{(n)}) - {\pi _j}} \right|}\].

The total variation is also called the `r Gloss('convergence rate')` because it
measures the convergence rate after $n$ years (or $n$
transitions).

***Example 8***

*Provide the total variations (convergence rate) in 20 years under the NCD system in Malaysia, assuming that the probability of claims is Poisson distributed with parameter* $\lambda = 0.10$*.*

***Solution***

*Using R program, the stationary probabilities are:*

\[
\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{{\pi _0}}\\\\{{\pi_1}}\\\\{{\pi _2}}\\\\
{{\pi _3}}\\\\{{\pi _4}}\\\\{{\pi_5}}
\end{array}} \right]
= \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{0.0952}\\\\{0.0861}\\\\{0.0779}\\\\
{0.0705}\\\\{0.0638}\\\\{0.6064}
\end{array}} \right]
\]

*The transition matrix in the first year is:*

\[
{\bf{P}}^{(1)} = \left[
{\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{0.0952}&{0.9048}&0&0&0&0\\\\
{0.0952}&0&{0.9048}&0&0&0\\\\
{0.0952}&0&0&{0.9048}&0&0\\\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&{0.9048}&0\\\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&0&{0.9048}\\\\
{0.0952}&0&0&0&0&{0.9048}
\end{array}} \right]
\]

*The variation can be computed as:*

\[
\begin{array}{l}
\left| {\sum\limits_i {\frac{p_{i0}^{}}{6}} - {\pi _0}} \right| = 0\\\\
\left|{\sum\limits_i {\frac{p_{i1}^{}}{6}} - {\pi _1}} \right| =
0.0647\\\\
\vdots \\\\
\left| {\sum\limits_i
\frac{p_{i5}}{6} - {\pi _5}} \right| =
.3048
\end{array}
\]

*Therefore, the total variation in the first year is*
$\sum\limits_j {\left| {\sum\limits_i {\frac{p_{ij}}{6} - {\pi _j}} } \right|} = 0.6096$*.*

*Using R program, the total variations (or convergence rate) in 20 years are:*

*0.6096, 0.3941, 0.2252, 0.0958, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.*

### R Program for Convergence Rate

The following R program can be used to calculate the total variation in
the $n$th year, and the total variations (convergence rates) in
20 years under the NCD system in Malaysia (the solution in Example 8).

```{r, echo=SHOW_PDF}
#transition matrix
TP

# stationary probability
SP=eigen(t(TP))$vectors[,1]/sum(eigen(t(TP))$vectors[,1])
SP

#create function for total variation in nth year
TV=function(n)
{dif=numeric(0)
for (j in 1:length(SP))
dif[j]=abs(mean(powA(n)[,j])-SP[j])
+ sum(dif)}

#example for n=1
TV(1)

#provide total variations (convergence rate) in 20 years
tot.var=numeric(0)
for (n in 1:20)
tot.var[n]=TV(n)
round(tot.var,4)
```

***Example 9***

*Provide the total variations (or convergence rate) in 20 years under
the NCD system in Brazil, assuming that the number of successive years
of claims is distributed as Poisson with parameter* $\lambda = 0.10$

***Solution***

*Using R program, the total variations (or convergence rates) in 20 years for the NCD system in Brazil are:*

*1.2617, 1.0536, 0.8465, 0.6412, 0.4362, 0.2316, 0.1531, 0.0747, 0.0480, 0.0232,*

*0.0145, 0.0071, 0.0043, 0.0021, 0.0013, 0.0006, 0.0004, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.0001.*

Examples 8-9 provide the degree of convergence for two different BMS
(two different countries). The Malaysian BMS reaches full stationary
only after four years, while the BMS in Brazil takes a longer period. As
mentioned in Lemaire (1998), a more sophisticated BMS would converge
more slowly, and is considered as a drawback as it takes a longer period
to stabilize. The main objective of a BMS is to separate the good
drivers from the bad drivers, and thus, it is desirable to have a
classification process that can be finalized (or stabilized) as soon as
possible.

## BMS and Premium Rating {#S:PremRtg}

### Premium Rating

Premium rating is the process of establishing premium rates in an
insurance system, or other risk transfer mechanisms. The process
involves a number of considerations such as statistical methods,
marketing goals, competition and legal restrictions. Premium rating
should fulfill four basic objectives generally agreed among the
actuaries; producing 'fair' premium rates whereby high risks insureds
pay higher premium and vice versa, providing sufficient funds for paying
incurred losses and expenses, providing adequate margin for adverse
deviation, and producing reasonable returns to insurers.

Before we discuss the application of BMS in premium rating, a brief
discussion of the Poisson and negative binomial regression models are
provided here. The Poisson regression has been widely used for fitting
count (or frequency) data in insurance area. The negative binomial
regression model can be used for fitting count (or frequency) data with
`r Gloss('overdispersion')`, which is a situation when the variance is larger than
the mean. However, students are encouraged to refer to textbooks on `r Gloss('GLM')`s or regression models available in the literature for a more comprehensive knowledge on the related subjects.

### Frequency Model -- Poisson and Negative Binomial Regressions

Let ${({Y_1},{Y_2},...,{Y_n})^T}$ be the vector of count
random variables and $n$ be the sample size. The probability
mass function (p.m.f.) for `r Gloss('Poisson regression model')` is,

\[\Pr ({Y_i} = {y_i})
\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
= \frac{{{\exp(- {\mu _i})}{\mu _i}^{y_i}}}{y_i{!}}&{y_i = 0,1,...}
\end{array}
\]

with mean and variance $E({Y_i}) = Var({Y_i}) = {\mu _i}$.
To take into account non-negative values, the mean, or the fitted value,
is assumed to follow a log link, $E({Y_i}) = {\mu _i} = \exp ({\bf x}_{\bf i}{\bf '\beta })$, where
${\bf{x}}_{\bf i}$ denotes the vector of explanatory
variables and ${\bf \beta}$ is the vector of regression
parameters. The maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained by
maximizing the log likelihood.

The p.m.f. for `r Gloss('negative binomial regression model')` is,

\[
\Pr ({Y_i} = {y_i}) = \frac{{\Gamma ({y_i} +
v)}}{y_i{!}\Gamma (v)}
\left( \frac{v}{v + {\mu _i}}
\right)^v
\left( \frac{\mu _i}{v + {\mu _i}}
\right)^{y_i},{y_i} = 0,1,2,...,
\]

where the mean is $E({Y_i}) = {\mu _i}$, the variance is
$Var({Y_i}) = {\mu _i}(1 + {v^{ - 1}}{\mu _i}) = {\mu _i}(1 + a{\mu _i})$, and ${v^{ - 1}} = a$ denotes the
dispersion parameter. The NB regression model reduce to the Poisson
regression model in the limit as $a \to 0$, and display
overdispersion when $a > 0$. The mean can also be assumed to
follow the log link, $E({Y_i}) = {\mu _i} = \exp ({{\bf x}_{\bf i}{\bf{'\beta }}})$, and the maximum
likelihood estimates can be obtained by maximizing the log likelihood.

### Premium Rating with Bonus-Malus Data

Under this section, we will consider the statistical approach of
obtaining premium rates using count data (frequency data) that provides
bonus-malus information on the risk profiles of the insureds.

**Example 10**

Consider the Canadian private automobile liability insurance data from
Bailey and Simon (1960). The data provides information on the number of
claims incurred and exposures (expressed in terms of number of earned
car years). The data is classified into two rating factors; merit rating
and class rating. Altogether, there are twenty $(4 \times 5)$
`r Gloss('cross-classified rating classes')` of claim frequencies (20 count data).
Table 5 provides the description of the two rating factors. It can be
seen that merit rating provides information on the number of
accident-free years, and thus, the information can be used as
bonus-malus information. Using the Canadian automobile insurance data:

(i) Fit the count data using Poisson regression model.

(ii) Calculate the premium assuming that the claim severity is 1000 for
    all rating classes.

(iii) Build a simple premium table, and suggest the percentage of
    discounts (or loadings) for the premiums if the BMS is to be
    considered.

\[
\begin{matrix}
\text{Table 5: Rating factors (Canadian data)}\\
\begin{array}{*{20}c}
\hline
\text{Merit} & \text{Class}\\
\hline\\
\text{A = licensed, accident-free ≥ 3 years } & \text{1 = pleasure, no male operator < 25 } \\
\text{X = licensed, accident-free 2 years } & \text{2 = pleasure, non-principal male operator < 25 } \\
\text{Y = licensed, accident-free 1 year } & \text{3 = business use } \\
\text{B = others} & \text{4 = unmarried owner / principal operator < 25} \\
& \text{5 = married owner / principal operator < 25 } \\\\
\hline
\end{array}
\end{matrix}
\]

**Solution**

(i) Table 6 provides the parameter estimates (and standard errors) for
    the Poisson regression model which is fitted to the count data.

(ii) The premiums are calculated by multiplying the fitted frequencies
    with the claim severities. The fitted frequency is obtained by
    dividing the fitted count with the exposure. The fitted count,
    $E({Y_i}) = {\mu _i} = {\hat y_i}$, is the fitted
    value obtained from the Poisson regression model. The premiums for
    all rating classes, are shown in Table 7.

(iii) Let the premium classified under merit B be the base premium. The
    premium relativities and the percentage of discounts for each rating
    class can be calculated, and the values are shown in Table 8. A
    simple premium table, which provides the percentage of discounts
    based on the number of accident-free years, can be constructed and
    is shown in Table 9. The discounts can be suggested for implementing
    the BMS.

### Premium Rating without Bonus-Malus Data

Under this section, we will consider the statistical approach of
obtaining premium rates using count data that does not provide
bonus-malus information on the risk profiles of the insureds.

**Example 11**

The dataset for private car Own Damage (OD) claim count in Malaysia
(Zamani and Ismail 2012, Ismail and Zamani 2013) is considered here. The
data is based on 1.01 million private car policies for a three-year
period of 2001-2003. The exposures are expressed in car-year units.
Table 10 shows the rating factors for the claim count data. Altogether,
there are $5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 625$
cross-classified rating classes of claim frequencies (625 count data).
However, the number of rating classes (sample size) reduces to 547 after
excluding count data with zero exposure. It can be seen from the
description in Table 10 that the data does not provide information on
the number of claim-free years (bonus-malus information). Using the
Malaysian private car insurance data:

(i) Fit the count data using Poisson and negative binomial regression
    models. Compare both models and suggest a preferred model for the
    data.

(ii) Calculate the premium assuming that the claim severity is MYR 1000
    (Ringgit Malaysia) for all rating classes.

(iii) Build a premium table, assuming that the NCD is to be implemented.

\[

\end{matrix}
\]

**Solution**

(i) Table 11 shows the parameter estimates (and standard errors) for the
    fitted Poisson and negative binomial regression models. The results
    indicate that the regression parameters of all models have similar
    estimates. The likelihood ratio for testing overdispersion between
    the Poisson and the NB models is 2844.14, indicating that the data
    is overdispersed and the NB is a better model. The `r Gloss('AIC')` and `r Gloss('BIC')` also
    indicate that the NB is a better model. Table 12 shows the parameter
    estimates (and standard errors) for the fitted negative binomial
    regression model with significant covariates (covariates with
    $p$-values larger than 0.10 are excluded). The NB model in Table 12
    is suggested as the preferred model for the data.

(ii) The premiums are calculated by multiplying the fitted frequencies
    with the claim severities. The premiums for the first 25 rating
    classes (vehicle age: 0-1 year and vehicle make: local-type 1) are
    shown in Table 13.

(iii) The Malaysian NCD system have six discount classes (0%, 25%, 30%,
    38.3%, 45% and 55%) for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5+ claim-free years. The
    final premium rates should be 'inflated' accordingly to take into
    account the NCD (discount entitlement) of each insured. We can use
    the stationary distribution to approximate the proportion of
    insureds in each NCD class (in the long run). Assume that the
    probability of a no-claim year for all NCD classes is 0.90. The
    stationary probabilities are (from Example 3):

\[
{\pi_0} = 0.1000,\rm{ }{\pi _1} = 0.0900,\rm{ }{\pi
_2} = 0.0810,\rm{ }{\pi _3} = 0.0729,\rm{ }{\pi _4} =
0.0656,\rm{ }{\pi _5} = 0.5905
\]

which indicates that 10% of insureds eventually belong to class 0
(zero claim-free years), 9% of insureds eventually belong to class 1
(one claim-free year), and so forth, until 59% of insureds eventually
belong to class 5 (or five successive claim-free years). After
implementing the NCD, the premium (in the long run) will be reduced
(on average) by the following factor:

\[
\begin{array}{l} 
= \sum\limits_j \text{(proportion of insureds in class }j)\text{(1 - NCD
in class }j) \\\\ 
= (0.1000)(1) + (0.0900)(1 - 0.25) + ... + (0.5905)(1 - 0.55)\\\\ 
= {0}{.570962}
\end{array}
\]

Therefore, the final premiums (after adjusting for the NCD) should be
inflated by $1 \div 0.57 = 1.75$. A premium table can be
constructed based on the factor (1.75). The final premiums for the
first 5 rating classes are shown in Table 14, and can be suggested for
implementing the NCD.
